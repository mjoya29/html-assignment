    <h2 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Hello, Welcome to my webpage! My name is Marc Joya, born and raised in Newmarket, Ontario. 
    I am currently 22 years old and live with my family in my hometown. 
    <br>I took IMD because I was really interested to see what this program holds, as well as the fact that it looked like a genuinely promising course!<br>
    I had a bit of experience in html but it was in highschool, so honestly I'm back at stage one.
     </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Other than school, I currently have a part-time job at Mcdonalds. I have a huge interest in video games, anime, and videography!<br>
         I actually have an annual project where I record clips of my friends and family throughout the year and then I make one big montage highlighting the most memorable moments of the year.<br>
          I usually do a voice over as well, just talking about how much I appreciate them and how much they’ve impacted my life.
           It’s very cheesy but, everyone likes to know that they’re appreciated every now and then right?</p>
